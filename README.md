SmartYield: Cotton Yield Prediction

SmartYield is a sophisticated project aimed at predicting cotton yields using advanced machine learning and data mining techniques. This project integrates diverse datasets, including weather, soil, and satellite data, to build a reliable and interpretable yield prediction model.

OBJECTIVES

The objective of the “Smart Yield” project is to enhance the accuracy of cotton yield prediction by 
developing and evaluating advanced regression models. The project aims to integrate key factors 
such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and specific cotton parameters into linear, 
polynomial, and non-linear regression models. By assessing these models using performance 
metrics like R², RMSE, ans MAPE, the project these models using performance metrics like R², 
RMSE, and MAPE, the project seeks to provide valuable insights for farmers, agricultural planners, 
and stakeholders. Ultimately, the goal is to improve crop management and resource allocation, 
boost cotton production efficiency, and support sustainable farming practices through more accurate 
and reliable yield forecasts.

Key Findings:

The implementation successfully achieved the core objectives:

• Model Performance: Non-linear regression models were found to be the most accurate for 
predicting cotton yields, surpassing both linear and polynomial models in terms of precision.

• Key Influences: Factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and cotton variety were 
identified as significant predictors of cotton yield, highlighting their importance in the 
forecasting process. 

• Data and Feature Selection: The project emphasized the necessity of high-quality data and 
proper feature selection to enhance model performance and accuracy.

• Decision-Making Support: The improved predictive accuracy provides valuable insights for 
farmers and stakeholders, aiding in more informed decisions about crop management and 
resource allocation.

• Sustainability and Efficiency: Accurate yield predictions contribute to optimizing resource 
use and support sustainable farming practices, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of cotton 
production.

Conclusion:

The “SmartYield” project has proven that non-linear regression models offer the most accurate 
predictions for cotton yields, outperforming traditional linear and polynomial models. By 
incorporating critical factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and cotton variety, the project 
underscored their significant impact on yield forecasting. The emphasis on high-quality data and 
thorough feature selection was crucial for achieving model accuracy. These advancements enable 
farmers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions, leading to improved crop management 
and resource allocation. Ultimately, the project supports more efficient and sustainable cotton 
production, benefiting both economic and environmental aspects of the
